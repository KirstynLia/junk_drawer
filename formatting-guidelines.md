# Abbreviations
- Always write out the entire term the first time you use the term
- After you've written the term once, you can abbreviate it throughout the rest of the copy
- Be sure to explain abbreviated terms if their meaning isn't immediately clear
- Avoid using abbreviations like e.g., i.e., or etc. as they aren't universally understood and can be difficult to localise

## Examples of how to use abbreviations:
- We would say: *Significantly not as described (or SNAD) items on Vinted...* the first time we use the term in an article.
- You may also consider adding the full definition the first time you reference the topic (e.g. *Significantly not as described (or SNAD) items are items that don’t match their listing description or photos.*)

---

# And or Ampersands (&)
- The written version of the word “and” is preferred to “&” for accessibility purposes. Avoid using "&" in most instances.
- “&” can be used sparingly in article titles, buttons and CTAS to save character space or when referencing brand names
- Don't use “+” instead of “&”.

## Examples of how to use ampersands: 
- We wouldn't say: *You can bump your items by going to your profile & tapping the Boost your visibility.*
- We would say: *Payments & withdrawals* (but only if it's the title of an article) 

---

# Bullets and lists (•) 

## How to use bullets and lists:
- Bulleted (unordered) and numbered (ordered) lists are one of the most powerful tools for improving readability on screens
- Bulleted lists should be used frequently, especially when describing multiple, disconnected points related to a single topic
- Use lists to break up large chunks of text
- Use numbered lists when describing steps of a feature flow or process
- Avoid using numbered lists in headings, as this can hinder readability

## How to format bullets and lists:
- Use parallel sentence construction for lists of items when possible. Each bullet point should start with the same type of word (e.g. a verb)
- Place line breaks before and after the list, but not between list items.
- Avoid adding full stops (.) to the end of bullet points, unless it’s the end of one sentence leading on to the next.
- Keep the formatting consistent. (e.g. if most of the list items are fragments, don't use punctuation at the end of any line, even if one of the lines is a full sentence)
- Consider bolding the first word or a phrase for ease of scanning.
- Style the bullets differently for each level when using multi-level lists

---

# Capitalisation
- We capitalise proper nouns and branded feature names (e.g. Bumps, Item Verification Service, only when written in their noun forms.)
- Verbs forms of the feature names are not capitalised (e.g. “bump this item,” “verify this item.”)
- Use sentence case for titles and headings, never use title case

## Productised terms - always capitalise the following terms:
- Vinted Balance
- Buyer Protection
- Refund Policy
- Item Authenticity Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Shipping Instructions
- Price List
- Item Bump / Bump (except when used as a verb)
- Listing Spotlight
- Catalogue Rules
- Infoboard
- Terms & Conditions
- Help Centre
- Vinted Pro
- Terms mentioned above that are Vinted-Pro-specific (Buyer Protection Pro, Refund Policy Pro, etc.)

## Other capitalisation use cases:
- Capitalise the main word in category names but not the other words (e.g. Men’s category, Pet care category, Kids’ category)
- Use lower case when referring to the items themselves within a category (e.g. men’s items, pet care items)
- For buttons, we typically only capitalise the first word (e.g., Buy now, Ask seller, View issue details, Save, etc.)
- Seasons: use lower case (e.g. spring, summer)
- Currency names: use lower case, (e.g. euro) or capitalise if using 3-letter abbreviation (e.g. GBP, USD)

## Examples of how to use capitalisation:
- We would say: *Browse designer items now*
- We wouldn't say: *Browse Designer Items Now*

---

# Colons (:) and semicolons (;)
- Use colons between numbers when writing the time.
- Follow with a capital letter if there’s a complete sentence after the colon. No capital letter after a colon if it’s followed by a sentence fragment.
- Semicolons aren't great for usability. If you need to create a pause in the copy, use a full stop, colon, comma, or em dash instead. 

## Examples of how to use colons: 
- We would say: *New: Find designer items on Vinted*
- We wouldn't say: *New: find designer items on Vinted*

---

# Commas (,)
- Try to minimise excessive use of commas. Only use a comma when it's grammatically necessary.
- Don't use commas to mimic the pattern of spoken language
- Include a comma before “and”/ “or” in lists of 3+ things (e.g. the Oxford comma)

## Examples of how to use commas: 
- We would say: *Our new categories are Entertainment, Pet care, and Home.*
- We wouldn’t say: *Our new categories are Entertainment, Pet care and Home.*

---

# Contractions (‘)

- Use contractions consistently to keep content conversational in tone.
- Consider using the full form of a phrase that can be made into a contraction for emphasis in serious situations

## Examples of how to use contractions:
- We would say: *Don’t, won't, can't, couldn't*
- Avoid saying: *Do not, will not, can not (cannot), could not*
- Example of using the full phrase for emphasis: *We will review and remove all listings that do not adhere to our Catalouge Rules.* 

---

# Currency
- Use the British formatting standard when writing English content in all locales: currency symbol first with no space between the symbol and the number and a full-stop (.) for the decimal point. 
- 2-letter currency acronyms may be used to describe currency in certain locales (e.g. zl - Polish zloty, 5.50 kr - Danish kroner). These should be lowercase and come after the currency denomination (e.g. 5.50 zl, 5.50 kr)
- 3-letter currency acronyms should typically be avoided, but should necessary in certain contexts. When using these, they should always be fully capitalised (e.g. USD, GBP, or EUR)
- When spelled out in full, do not capitalise currency names (e.g. dollar, pound or euro)
- Note: decimalisation and currency symbol guidelines are different in some locales and in non-English content. See the Glossary for guidance.

## Examples of how to format currencies:
- We would say: *First, make sure you don’t exceed the tax threshold of €7,499.99*
- We wouldn’t say: *First, make sure you don’t exceed the tax threshold of 7.499,99 €*

---

# Dates
- We typically use the long-form date format: numeric day first, with month after (e.g. 13 April)
- The short-form date should look like this: numeric day/month, separated by a forward-slash (e.g. 13/04). We don't typically use the short-form date in help content. 
- Write dates in the UK format: day, month, then year (e.g. 13/04/2024)
- We don’t typically include the year unless required legally or for clarity (e.g. a campaign that runs December to January)
- Don't use ordinal numbers

## Date ranges
- For long-form date ranges, don't add a space when writing dates in the same month (e.g. 13–20 April).
- For long-form date ranges, spell out the dates when mentioning a time period between different months (e.g. 13 April to 13 May)
- For short-form date ranges, separate the numbers with a forward slash. Use only numbers and don't add spaces between the characters (e.g. 13/04–20/04)
- Use an en dash, not a hyphen, to separate the numbers for both long and short-form dates
- State specifically when a date or date range is inclusive of the start/end dates by putting the word (inclusive) in brackets.

## Decades: 
- Decades should be written like this: 60s, 70s, 80s
- Avoid using apostrophes and don't include the century

## Examples of how to format dates:
- We would say: Send it by 2 December (inclusive).
- We would say: (17/05-31/05)
- We wouldn't say: Send it by 6th October (inclusive).
- We wouldn't say: *Highlighting your favourite 60's fashion* or *Score a deal on looks from the 1970's*

---

# Ellipses (...)

- Ellipses are bad for usability. Avoid using them.
- If you need to create a pause in the copy, consider using colons, em dashes or full stops instead.
- Example: We would say *Introducing: The new Bumps feature*, We wouldn't say *Introducing… The new Bumps feature*

---

# Emphasis (bold, italic, etc) 

## Italics: 
- Avoid using italics to emphasise specific words or text
- Don't use italics to emphasise quoted text
- Italics may be used sparingly in chatbot content to add additional structure or context (there aren't any specific guidelines on this yet. Use your best judgement)

## Bold:
- Can be used to emphasise key information, but use sparingly to avoid overwhelming the reader.
- Can be at the start of a bullet point to break up text 
- Use bold to refer to user pathways (like menu titles or button text) in the product or UI when writing step-by-step instructions (see: referring to the interface for more detail)
- Punctuation marks following bold text should not be bold, unless every preceding word in the sentence is bold.
- Do not use bold in place of appropriate heading styles (H1, H2, H3)


## Examples of how to use emphasis:
- We would say: *Sellers can press **Re-upload item** on their conversation screen to put the item on sale again.*
- We would say: *If you can’t send the order in time, you can ask the buyer to agree on extending the shipping deadline by **3 or 5 additional business days**.*

---

# Exclamation marks (!)
- Exclamation marks should be used very sparingly. They typically do not convey the right tone in most help-related situations.
- Never use more than one exclamation mark per screen to avoid sounding overly excited or juvenile.


## Examples of how to use exclamation marks:
- We would say: *Success! You sold an item.*
- We wouldn't say: *Success. You sold an item.*
- We wouldn't say: *Success!! You sold an item!!*

---

# Full stops (.)
- You should typically choose full stops over colons and dashes in writing to avoid creating overly-long sentences.
- Avoid full stops on the end of bullet points, unless it’s the end of one sentence leading on to the next.
- Don't use full stops in titles, headings or buttons

## Examples of how to use full stops:
- We would say: Upload your tax ID now to keep using Vinted
- We wouldn't say: Upload your tax ID now to keep using Vinted.

---

# Headings and subheadings

## How to use headings:
- A heading should tell the reader what the content beneath it (e.g. the following "section" of the article) is about.
- Use headings to organize content when you are presenting multiple, related topics or ideas in one article. 
- Always use headings to break up an article if the reader needs to scroll to access key information.
- Always consider using headings before other elements (like accordions or tables) to organise content.
- If there is a lot of text under each heading, consider using accordions to further organize the content
- If your content has many headings and/or subheadings, consider adding a table of contents at the beginning of the article with direct links to each section 

## How to format headings: 
- Always use the appropriate markup heading level (e.g. H1, H2, H3). Never format headings like body text (e.g. bolding or making the text bigger to create a header)
- Include keywords or key terms that summarize the content contained in the section beneath it. Front-load (use in the first 2-3 words) these keywords whenever possible
- Omit non-essential words (such as pronouns and articles) to keep headings concise
- Don't use punctuation at the end of headings, unless the heading is written as a question
- Use sentence case, never use title case or all-caps
- Headings may be followed by a colon for emphasis if it makes sense in context (use your best judgement)

## How to use and format subheadings:
- Subheadings may be helpful for further organizing or bringing emphasis to important subtopics in a section. Like at the beginning of a bulleted list.
- Subtitles are written as regular text, but are typically written on a separate line from the rest of the copy. 
- Subtitles aren't assigned a heading level, but consider bolding subheadings to give them additional emphasis.
- Subtitles are often followed by a colon and written in sentence case

## Examples of how to use headings and subheadings: 
- We might use the headings *What are shipping options?* and *Managing your shipping options* in an article titled "How shipping works"
- We might use the headings *Buying a Bump from your profile* and *Buying a bump while creating a listing* in an article titled "How to buy an Item Bump"
- We might use the subheading *Some examples of illegal listings include:* as part of a section with the heading "Reporting illegal listings on Vinted" in an article titled "Reporting illegal content or inappropriate behaviour"

---

# Hyphens & dashes (– / -)

## Hyphens:
- Only use hypens to connect compound words (e.g. up-to-date). Do not use it to break up copy.
- Avoid using hyphens to break up one word over two lines (e.g. line breaks)
- In compound adjectives (a.k.a. phrasal adjectives), use hyphens on the words that make up the compound adjective if it comes before the noun, but not if the compound phrase is being used as an adverb and comes after the noun.
- Adverbs that end in -ly as part of compound adjectives shouldn’t be hyphenated.
- You can also use dashes to stylistically connect words such as pre-loved and new-again

## En dashes: 
- Use en dashes only for communicating dates or time ranges without spaces

## Em dashes:
- Use to separate information or mark a break in a sentence
- Can be used (sparingly) in place of other punctuation, like parentheses or semicolons, when a full stop feels too strong.
- Don't use the 2-em dash or 3-em dash

## Examples of how to use hyphens and dashes:
- We would say: *Get up–to–date information* or *Stay up–to–date.*
- We wouldn’t say: The link should be clearly-visible below.
- We would say: *Try Bumps – sell your items faster.*
- We wouldn’t say: *Try Bumps-sell your items faster*
- We would say: *13–20 April*
- We wouldn't say: *13 - 20 April*

---

# Links

## How to use hyperlinks and in-line linking:
- Ensure that hyperlinks describe the information they're leading the reader to (note: this is very important for readers who rely on accessibility tools).
- Links should take the reader to the final answer or related source. They should never lead the reader down a "trail of links".
- Consider cross-linking to related articles and topics when discussing them in the copy to help readers discover additional information about the topic.
- Avoid adding too many links to a single piece of content. They can become distracting or overwhelming (use your best judgment) 
  
## Section (on-page) links:
- If your content has multiple sections with defined section headings (H1, H2, etc), you can link to these sections in other areas of the content to guide the reader to a specific topic quickly. This may be helpful when working on long content pieces. 
- If your content has many headings and/or subheadings, consider adding a table of contents at the beginning of the article with direct links to each page section to help the reader jump to the sections quickly.

## How to format links:
- Don't link to a destination more than once in a single article (even if using different hyperlinked text to describe the link)
- Aim to use no more than 4-5 words in a hyperlink, though you can make exceptions if you need to prioritise text readability
- Avoid creating short, non-descriptive links (e.g. "click here" or "Learn more")
- Avoid using the term "see more..." (as this language isn't inclusive)
- Don't include punctuation in the hyperlink

## Examples of how to use links:
- We would say: *Learn more about how to use your Vinted Balance*
- We would say: *Learn more* 

---

# Numbers, measurements and percentages

## Nominal numbers:
- Always write these numbers in text as numerals (e.g. 7, 17, 177)
- Exception: spell out the number in full when it's at the start of a sentence or when doing so is necessary to create clarity (use your best judgement)
- Use full stops for decimal numbers and currency subunits, such as pennies, cents, and fractions (e.g. €5.00 or 0.95%)
- When writing larger numbers, use a comma to mark bundles of thousands, tens of thousands, etc (e.g. 1,000; 100,000; 1,000,000)

## Ordinal numbers: 
- Write as a full word when at the start of a sentence (e.g. “second”)
- Write as a numeral everywhere else (e.g. “2nd”)
- Only use “1st” if there’s also a “2nd,” otherwise spell out “first” in full.
- Avoid writing “th” in superscript.
- Don’t use ordinal numbers for dates.

## Measurements:
- When indicating measurements of length or distance (e.g., centimeters, meters), do not insert a space between the numerical value and the unit of measurement.

## Percentages (%): 
- Percentages should be written as a number (e.g. “33%” not “1/3rd”)
- Don't add space between the numbers and % symbol.

## Examples of how to write numbers: 
- We wouldn't say: *€5,55.00*
- We wouldn’t say: *Screen size is 20 cm.*
- We would say: *The width is 5cm*
- We wouldn't say: *5th April*
- We would say: *Earn two Vinted vouchers worth €5 total* (normally, we wouldn't spell out "two", but here it gives the sentence more clarity)

---

# Referring to the UI or product

- Use bold to refer to user pathways (like menu titles or button text) when writing step-by-step instructions (e.g. "Select **Settings**, then **Profile details** to change your profile description"). Avoid bolding other text in step-by-step instructions to avoid confusion.
- Use double quotation marks when referring to the interface in a regular sentence/paragraph (do not bold)
- Always capitialise the first word of a UI string (e.g. "I have an issue" not "i have an issue")
- Always follow any other capitalisation that is shown in the UI (e.g. "Everything is OK" not "everything is ok" or "everything is okay")
- Avoid adding directional information whenever possible, since the interface changes often (e.g. "Press the **I have an issue** button on this screen" instead of "Press the **I have an issue button** at the bottom of this page")
- Use the term "Press" to refer to interacting with UI elements and buttons since the term can be used in both web and mobile instructions. Avoid using terms like "click" or "tap" that aren't device-agnostic.
- Refer to the Writer's Guild glossary for more information on how to use specific UI terminology


---

# Paragraphs

- Aim to break information into meaningful chunks to help readers process and understand it better. Consider using subheadings and lists to break up paragraphs and avoid long columns of unformatted text.
- Try to keep paragraphs concise. A single paragraph should be approximately 3-5 sentences or ±40 words long.
- The first sentence of each paragraph should introduce its main ideas and keywords (if applicable).
- If possible, avoid formatting sentences as paragraphs (e.g. placing a single sentence alone on a separate line followed by a hard return).
- Avoid bolding large chunks of text or entire paragraphs. 


---

# Speech marks & quotations (“,’)
- Use double quotation marks when quoting someone (e.g. “I love Vinted.”)
- Use double quotation marks when referring to the interface in a regular sentence/paragraph (do not bold)
- Don't use double quotation makrs when referring to the interface in step-by-step instructions (use bold instead)
- Avoid using single quotation marks
- Place punctuation outside of the quotation marks, unless the punctuation is part of a statement that you're quoting.

## Examples of how to use quotations:
- We would say: The money will move to your Balance after the buyer presses “Everything is OK”.
- We would say: "I've been an avid Vinted shopper for 15 years."

---

# Time
- Use 24-hour time as a standard when giving instructions (e.g. drop-off location opening hours)

## Time ranges: 
- Use a colon in the text before writing the time range
- Use a colon to separate hours and minutes
- Use a dash and no spaces in between to write the wrange (e.g. 10:30–14:30)


## Examples of how to format times: 
- We would say: Opening hours: 10:00-17:00
- We wouldn’t say: Opening hours: 10am-5pm

---

# Titles
- Keep titles as concise as possible
- “&” can be used in article titles to save on character count or to make a title shorter, but use it sparingly
- Try to include the most important keyword at the beginning of the title (e.g. front-load the keywords)
- Skip articles and pronouns when possible to keep titles concise
- We typically avoid phrasing titles as questions or starting titles with "How to..." though in some cases, you may do so if it better conveys the message or main idea of the article
- Avoid nominalisations unless you're describing a process

## Examples of how to format titles: 
- We wouldn't say: *Setting up your shipping options*
- We would say: *Set up your shipping options* 
- We wouldn't say: *How do custom shipping methods work?*
- We would say: *How custom shipping methods work* or better yet *Using custom shipping*
